# Clout-Social-Credit-Score-Monitoring-Service
The clout social credit score monitoring service.
Clout is a social credit score monitering service.
Now you get rewarded for showing up on time.  
Do good deeds your score goes up.
Do bad deads your score goes down.

Good and bad deeds explained: A good deed is any time you extend your self to others in a positive way.
Agreeing to a meeting, or date or like-wise initiating a meeting or date etc... are concidered good deeds. 
However, showing up late, canceling or being an over all headach to deel with will cause your score to decrease.

Every user will start with a score of 200.  Each user, upon accepting or creating deed-transactions will be given 
a score increase. This score is subject to change based on the out come of those deed-transactions.  At the moment, 
what is considered a high score and what is considered a low score is not established as this may mean different things, 
for different users.
